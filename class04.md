# Chapter 4: “Links”

 We use the ***\<a\>*** element with the **href** attribute to indicate the page you are linking to. When the user click the link the browser takes the user to the requested page or URL that is mentioned in **href** attribute.

 This example shows how to create a link to (LTUC.com) :

# Chapter 15: “Layout”

You can position HTML element in three different ways:
- Normal flow: which is the default position for an element.
- Relative Positioning: this shifts the element from its normal flow to the specified (top, right, bottom, or left)
- Absolute positioning: this shifts the element from its normal flow to the specified (top, right, bottom, or left) in relation to the containing or parent element.

Also you can  float elements using the float property.

# Chapter 3 : “Functions, Methods, and Objects” 

The Object represents one of JavaScript data type. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities and it resembles real life objects such as hotel, car with their attribute (properties) and functionality (methods).

Function: is a set of statements to perform a specific task, it’s used to minimize code redundancy and organize the code into smaller tasks.

To declare a function you should use the following syntax:

    function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
    // code to be executed
    }

When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
