Git is one of the implementations for Version Control Systems (VSC) 

Version Control Systems in brief provides a centralized Repository or project structure to all team members and give the ability to work in parallel avoiding most conflicts. it track every file change and allows team members to safely save their changes to the project and get new changes from the project

VCS provide a set of commands using terminals or using a GUI clients

There is a standard set of features and/or actions related to any VCS that applies also to Git and here are the basic set of them:

Repository: is the centralized project structure that includes configuration files and work files, all control commands save and read from this repository
Commit: is to push a new file version to the repository
Checkout: is to pull an updated/fresh file from the repository
