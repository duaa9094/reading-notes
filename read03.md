HTML tags are of different purposes and types, for example tags that shows visible elements such as \<img\> ,\<a\> ,\<h1\> to \<h6\>, etc. 
Other tags are used for grouping and providing sections for the page layout such as \<div\> ,\<nav\>, \<header\>, etc.
One category are special purpose tags and markup that provide additional infromation and facilities for developers and broswer such as \<meta\>, \<!-- comment --\>, \<iframe\>, and <!DOCTYPE> that defines the HTML version (HTML4, XHTML, HTML5)  

HTML5 defined new page structure and layout tags such as \<header\>, \<footer\>, \<nav\> and many other which made it more clear and semantic to the developers compared to html pages prior to HTML5 that heavily depends on \<div\> tag with lots of style code.
