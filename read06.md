# CSS & Color
Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps 
convey the mood and evokes reactions

There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: 
RGB values, hex codes, and color names as follows

### RGB Values
```
    p {
    color: rgb(100,100,90);
    }
```

### HEX Codes
```
    h2 {
    color: #ee3e80;
    }
```

```
### Color Name
    h1 {
    color: DarkCyan;
    } 
```

CSS3 added color opacity and the HSL (Hue Saturation Lightness) method of defining colors
