## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

 A one who write the first web servers and the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

2. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

3. What does a GET do?

Retrieve whatever information (in the form of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI

4. What does a POST do?

POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line

5. What does PUT do?

PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server.

6. What does PATCH do?

Is a request method supported by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) protocol for making partial changes to an existing resource. The PATCH method provides an entity containing a list of changes to be applied to the resource requested using the HTTP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
