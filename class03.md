# Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops”

The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value to a case clause, and executes statements associated with that case, as well as statements in cases that follow the matching case.

JavaScript is a weak typing language, therefor data types can be coerced from one type to another.

There are three types of loops: **for**, **while**, and **do ... while**. Each repeats a set of statements.
